    "# Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction\n",
    "## Short Description:\n",
    "- Heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. People with heart disease or who are at high risk of heart disease need early intervention to prevent future undesirable outcomes. In this project, we are going to use a dataset that contains 11 features considered vital in identifying people with heart disease, and we are going to test it with four machine learning models— *KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes*— that will predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease."
